===========
MAZE SOLVER
===========

--------
OVERVIEW
--------

This program attempts to solve a maze with one or multiple exits within a certain turn limit. Movement in crossroads is chosen randomly.
However, if it gets surrounded by walls and areas it has already been to, the program is smart enough to backtrack its route to a point
where it can once again start searching through new areas
Custom made mazes can be inserted into \mazes folder. They must be in TXT format and the mazes themselves must obey certain rules:

-Allowed characters are: 'E' for exit, '#' for wall, ' ' for empty space, '^' for starting point. Any other characters will cause the program to fail.
-Mazes must be rectangular, ie. each row must be of equal length
-Each maze must have at least one exit and only one starting point
-Empty spaces are not allowed on the borders

Do note that based on these rules it is possible to run an unsolvable maze (all exits are unreachable behind walls). The program will recognize this and react accordingly.

The program will trim accidental or incidental empty rows and empty characters surrounding rows.

---------
EXECUTION
---------

Start the program from Maze solver.exe.
If there are more than one TXT files in \mazes, user will get to choose which one is run. If there is only a single file, no input is asked.
The program will attempt to run the maze with 20, 150, 200 turns, in that order. Results for all attempts are saved in a TXT file at \mazes\results.
User is shown a basic overview of all the essential properties before execution.
Maximum turn amount --> See section SETTINGS
The results file the basic data of the maze, result of the attempt, map of the movement done and also a turn-by-turn log of each move taken. I may add a map
of the optimal solution route in the future as well. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to implement it in this first draft.
If multiple attempts are made, the previous file is overwritten, so make sure to save in a different directory if necessary!

--------
SETTINGS
--------

User can customize some of the program's settings if they wish. This, however, is done at one's (or rather, the program's) peril. For example, setting
maze file maximum height limit to ten billion and running such a maze is probably not going go very well.

The settings with their default values are:

USERSELECTTURNLIMIT=false
When true, user will be prompted to give their own turn limit, instead of the default static values. However, only single attempts can be make with this setting.

MOVEMENTRANGEMAXLIMIT=500
MOVEMENTRANGEMINLIMIT=10
Maximum and minimum limits the user can give if USERSELECTTURNLIMIT=true

MAZEMAXEXITS=10
Max number of exits a maze can have

MAZEMAXHEIGHT=99
MAZEMAXWIDTH=99
MAZEMINHEIGHT=10
MAZEMINWIDTH=10
Maximum and minimum dimensions a maze can have

IMPORTANT: Setting values do not have any kind of error checking and the values are not generated by the program in case they are deleted. In case the file is deleted/corrupted,
create a new settings.txt and paste the 8 values above in that.





Have fun!
